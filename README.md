# Contacts



## Running the app

Use the package manager npm to install.

```bash
npm install
```



Start the application:

```bash
npm start
```



You will be able to use the application on http://localhost:3000/



## Using the app

The app is deployed on AWS s3 bucket: https://takeproject.s3.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html



## How to use?

- The application starts with no contact favorite
- Click on the start to set contact as favorite
- Click on the card to go to contact details
- It was designed for web, but adapted to use on mobile



## Pendencies

- I had no time to configure aws s3 properly, so you can only access the website by index.html path
- I had no time to make unit tests
